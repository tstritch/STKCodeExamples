# Az El Polar Plot

A basic example that demonstrates automating STK with python via either comtypes or win32com.  The script creates a scenario, inserts a satellite and facility.  Then access is calculated and azimuth and elevation data is extrated for each of the computed access intervals.  This data is then plotted on a polar plot.

To run this example you will need: either comtypes or win32com, numpy, and matplotlib.
