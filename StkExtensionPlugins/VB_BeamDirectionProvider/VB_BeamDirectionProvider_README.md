This VBScript can be used inside a phased array antenna.  The script drives the antenna beam to search within a user-defined area.  When the range from the antenna to the tracked object reaches a certain threshold, the antenna will switch from searching within that user-defined area to track the desired object.  The user must load in the script from the Beam Direction Provider tab in the phased array antenna properties page.  Change the 'Type' dropdown to 'Script' and load in the file.  The user must also select a target object for the beam pointing.
